If you want to learn how to emulate Arm64 based binary using Qiling framework which internally uses Unicorn engine, then do watch this video.

Qiling Framework is designed as a binary instrumentation and binary emulation framework that supports cross-platform and multi-architecture targets. It is also packed with powerful features such as code interception and arbitary code injection before or during a binary execution and hotpatching packed binary.

In this video we have tried to show how to emulate Arm64 based binary on Intel architecture by making use of this framework in order to solve real world challenges.
For this purpose, we have used this challenge developed by QilingLab:
